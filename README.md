# Runtime Environment - A Fitness and Health Enterprise Portal

## Project Domain:

**Health and Fitness**

## Description:

As important as it is to have high-end equipment, it's also very crucial to stay up-to-date on technology to attract new customer and keep up with the fierce competition. More so, many fitness centers are unable to retain existing members, maintain quality standards and track records which lead to a stagnant business. So, there is an urgent need to implement a technology which will help health clubs, fitness centers and gyms to manage and monitor their organization efficiently along with being accessible to customers conveniently.
